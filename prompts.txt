The deploy script needs a prefligh script to check if there already is a tailscale machine registered.. so that it wouldn't REREGISTER the same machine under another name... we need dependency stability... especially for services like postgresql

How possible is it for `sovereign start --sql` to stdout/err the boot sequence of alpine? can we tap into that? so that we don't have to blindly wait for a startup to finish, and then tapping into the postgresql startup sequence... then taking that as an indication that the startup is done...

But btw we need to debug the mysql startup first

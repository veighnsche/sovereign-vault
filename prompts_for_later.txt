Don't forget that we are on a x64 machine targeting an arm64 device

You know what I missed... what about find out about ALL the current behaviors in the SQL build/deploy/start/status/test/stop/remove commands in sovereign... and we need to test EACH BEHAVIOR in a test file.... THEN we need all the same behaviors for forgej

---

Now also make sure that forgejo is ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO POSTGRESQL through tailscale vpn

---

Now please do the entire stuff

build -> deploy -> start -> status -> test -> stop -> remove

And everything has to work as expected...

PLEASE START IMPLEMENTING EVERYTHING UNTIL TEST TEST PASSES COMPLETELY!
